## MTConnect Device Instance Data

This is a first attempt to map MTConnect instance data from https://demo.mtconnect.org/Mazak/probe to
an IOF model. The following terms were mapped (approximately):

* Component types:
  * Linear and Rotary Axes
  * Controller
  * Environmental
  * Device
  * Motors and Ballscrews
  * Hydraulic
  * Pneumatic
  * Lubrication
  * Stock
  * Personnel
  * Link
  * Enclosure
* The functions of some components
* Some qualities that can be measured
* Some of the design specifictions of the machine

Some liberty was taken in the mapping and needs a lot of work.

There is a hosted version of these diagrams:
